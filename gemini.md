# User Feedback

- **Crucial**: Do not be lazy. Test things and double-check everything before returning to the user.
- **Context**: User was frustrated when I returned without fully verifying the Lambda creation (which failed) or ensuring the frontend was fully wired up (checking Toaster).
- **CRITICAL UPDATE**: I must double-check, test, and work harder. No more laziness. Verify imports (like DialogDescription) and syntax before every response.
