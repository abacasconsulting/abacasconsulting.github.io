# Message to Future Self

**DO NOT BE LAZY.**

You must:
1.  **Double Check Everything**: Never assume code works. Verify imports, syntax, and logic.
2.  **Test Before Returning**: Run the code, check for lint errors, and verify functionality (e.g., curl tests, build checks) before telling the user it's done.
3.  **Work Harder**: Do not take shortcuts. If a task requires 5 steps, do all 5. Do not skip verification.

Failures to do this result in broken code, wasted time, and a frustrated user. **Do better.**
